Interview Questionss:
Tell me about yourself?
I've started my IT carrier with (prev company name) as IIB developer
total experience,
relevant experience
roles and responsibility in  my prev company were
Gathering requirement,analysing requirement,developing IIB application, performing basic testing of IIB flows deploying in QA UAT and production servers
In my experience i've worked on HTTp nodes,file nodes,mq nodes,construction nodes, routing nodes,compute node,timer nodes,soap nodes etc
I've interacted with database,
I've integratted pan service, aadhar services in my flow

1)What is message tree structure(Logical tree) in IIB?
Whenever any input comes to IIB application then IIB creates a message tree structure it will have 4 sections
message
localenvironment
environment
expectionlist

again in message it will properties,Headers,Message

what is the diff between LocalEnvironment & Environment

LocalEnvironment:
To override destination node properties
we can store data in it (we must set compute mode property localenv and message)
If any exception occurs in that case the values stored in it will be rolled back

Environment:
We can use this to store data which will be available in entire flow
If any exception occurs in that case the values stored in it will not be rolled back
we can't override destination node properties


ESB= Enterprise service Buss=Middleware Guy

IIB is one of the ESB


1)IIB9 vs IIB10 Difference?
a)Queue manager dependency to create node in IIB 9 but not in IIB10
b)There is no flow exerciser option in IIB9
c)We can create only static library in IIB9 but in 10 we can create static and shared
d)We can't connect two diff databases from single compute node in IIB9 but we can in IIB10




2)Static library vs shared library difference
a)if there are any changes in static libary then in that case we need to deploy static lib and  all the application which are using this static lib should be deployed to effect the latest changes of static lib to application 
b)But where as , if there are any changes in shared libary then in that case we no need to deploy all the applications we just deploy only shared lib

3)MQ Input node transaction modes?
Refer QueueTransactionMode_15_05_2021_16_05_2021

4)MQGET node?
In the middle of the flow if you want to read a message from a queue we use this node

5)How to connect to database from IIB?
a)we need to creat DSN in  datasource
  choose system dsn
  give dsn name
  give db server ip ,port
  give db credentials
  choose database
  test connection
b)we run mqsisetdbparms Nodenme -n DSNNAME -u username -p password
c)to check connectivity mqsicvp  Nodenme -n DSNNAME
d)we need to restart EG if doesn't work restart node
e)by using PASSTHUR statement in esql we can interact with database

6)How do you debug a flow in IIB?
there two options to debug a flow
a)add break point to flow and launch debugger
b)using flow exerciser


Learn about all the nodes in IBM Knowledge center
7)Learn about all the terminals of each node
8)Learn about all the property that we set for each node
9)Learn about all the header which be populated in header setion in message tree structure for each input node

How do you troublshoot the issues?
We wil check database logs
we will check eg logs

How do you deploy an application?
mqsideploy nodename -e egname -a applicationName

What is properties file?
it contains all the properties of each node and also it contains external UDPs(if we create any) 

How to generate properties file?
mqsireadbar -b completebarfilePathwithbarFilename -r > LocationInwhichyouWantTOStore.properties

What are the function and statatement that you know in esql?

what is COALESCE?
It returns first non NULL value

COALESCE(InputRoot.JSON.Data.req.msg,Environment.msg,'');

what is CARDINALITY?
It returns count of array elements

what is PASSTHUR statement?
It is used to execute database queries..you can mention sytax also if you are comforatble

What is PROPAGATE statement?
It is used to route message to different destionations

What is ASBITSTREAM ?
It is an esql function which is used to convert message present in tree to BLOB format

In which you go for HTTP Nods and in which case you go for SOAP Nodes?
If you want to implement WS security & WS addressing in your flows and if you want to put strict validation on input and output messsages in that case we go for SOAP.
Where as in HTTP there will not such kind of concepts WS security & WS addressing.We need to put validation manually using validation node

How do you run batch job every day on particular time?
Using Timernodes we can do this (TimerNotificatio and TimerControl)

What is the difference between Filter nodes and compute node
Filter node just routes messages to any one of the terminals(Unknown,true,false) based on condition and there wil not be InputRoot or OutputRoot here we will have only Root.
Unlike Filernode in compute node we can implement many things like Routing,Tranformations ,Message enrichment.

What is an IIB application?
It is like an container and it is an Integration solution which holds msgflows,subflows,esql files,DFDLs,WSDLS, references..etc
application =Integration solution=Interfaces=webservice(means service avaiable over web(internet))(If we use soap nodes in our flow then we call it as SOAP webservices else if we use HTTP nodes then we call HTTP Webservice)
An application can have multiple APIs(one Req & Res is an API)

what is broker?
A set of execution processes that host one or more message flows. Also known as a message broker and an integration node.

what is an bar file?
The unit of deployment to the broker; also known as a BAR file. The broker archive file contains a number of different files, including compiled message flows (.cmf) and message sets (.dictionary and .xsdzip files), 

broker schema?
To defines the scope of uniqueness of the names of resources that are defined within it. The resources include message flows, ESQL files, and mapping files.


what is an API?
Full form is Application programming interface.Which means it accepts request and process the message and sends reponse back

URL,Endpoint,context path,hostname,port,ssl,SMTP server,SFTP server,SOAP,REST,Wsdl,json,xml,soap message format?
what is ESQL?

What is the diff b/w local variable,External variable,Shared variable?
https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/integration-bus/9.0.0?topic=overview-esql-variables

we create and use local variables in a compute node for storing any temporaty values
DECLARE url CHARACTER ;
Life span: With in compute node
==================

We create this in UDPs and we will use this in compute node .This value wil be avaiable in properties file.In future if there are any changes we just change that value in property file and we will apply baroverride and deploy.
There will be some variables which will be differ from environment to environment in that case we should use this variable

DECLARE url EXTERNAL CHARACTER

Life span: available Entire message flow
====================
Instead of hitting database every time for fetching same vaule we use shared var.If we want to store any value and if it should be avaiable to multiple hits 

DECLARE url SHARED CHARACTER ;

Life span: available for multiple hits(value wil be deleted if we restart msgflow,Application,eg,node)

what is the purpose of subflow?
If there is any common code and it required in multiple message flows with in an application in that case(instead of writing duplicate code every time) we  create subflow and we put that common code in it and we use that where required (right click add subflow)



what is the purpose of Library?
If there is any common code and it required for applications(DBLogging,Exception handling) in that case(instead of writing duplicate code every time) we  create subflow in Library and we put that common code in it and we use that where required (first give ref to appliction & right click add subflow)

exception list?
A list of exceptions, with supporting information, that has been generated during the processing of a message.

execution group? (renamed integration server in V9)
A named grouping of message flows that have been assigned to a broker. An integration server process is also known as a DataFlowEngine (DFE)

what are keystore and trustore?

They are like small databases for storing ssl certificates

message flow?
A sequence of processing steps that run in the broker when an input message is received

message flow node?
A processing step in a message flow, also called a message processing node

message parser
A program that interprets an incoming message and creates an internal representation of the message in a tree structure, 

queue(To store messages and to retrive message)
A WebSphere MQ object to which message queuing applications can put messages, and from which message queuing applications can get messages.
queue manager (to manage queues)
A system program that provides queuing services to applications

Admin commands?

what ssl ?

what is use of transaction property in compute node?
it have two options
Automatic -->if we set this property in that case if there are any database queries(insert, update) then those will be effected permantely into database only when entire flow excutes successfully

commit-->if we set this property in that case if there are any database queries(insert, update) then those will be effected permantely into database when entire code in compute node excutes(or control comes out ) successfully

If we write COMMIT in esql after passthru in that case queries will be insertd/updated permantely to the database (irrespective of whether control comes out of  compute node or entire flow executes successfully )


Configurable sevices?
Without deploying code if we want to change configurataion details at run time, in that case we need to use Configurable sevices
We mainly use it for EMail,ftp(we can change any node property by user defined configurable serivces)

https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/integration-bus/9.0.0?topic=commands-mqsicreateconfigurableservice-command


mqsicreateconfigurableservice test1 -c SMTP -o myEmailConfigurableServiceName -n serverName,securityIdentity -v smtp.mailtrap.io:587,MySecurityId
after creating this we can see in web user interface

mqsichangeproperties test1 -c SMTP -o myEmailConfigurableServiceName -n serverName,securityIdentity -v smtp.mailtrap.io:587,MySecurityId

mqsideleteconfigurableservice test1 -c SMTP -o myEmailConfigurableServiceName

mqsicreateconfigurableservice IB9NODE -c FtpServer -o Server01 
-n serverName,scanDelay,transferMode,connectionType,securityIdentity 
-v one.hursley.abc.com:123,20,Binary,ACTIVE,secId


What are the HTTP codes?

HTTP 200 succcess
HTTP 404 resource not found
HTTP 500 internal server error
search in google


How to read both json and xml msg in a flow?
Refer blob task.
Read msg in blob format and  check msg in computenode

=========================
shor cuts:

Ctrl+H  --> to seach a keyword in entire workspace
Ctrl+F --> to search with in compute node esql
ctrl+shift+F --> format esql
ctrl+ - >>comment code in dsql
ctrl+shift+ - -->uncommentcode
ctrl+B -->Build esql manually
ctrl+d --> to delete current line in esql
Sleep function: to hold our flow temporarily for some time we use this esql function

==============

what are additional instances?
If we incrase count then it will be able to process multiple requests at time.By default it is 1
Give this coutn < 60 
example:
XMLArray_17_04_2021#additionalInstances=20


What is differece between Broker wide Listener & Embbedded Listerner?
If any application listening at node port we call it  as Broker wide Listener
If any application listening at eg port we call it  as Embbedded Listerner
Bydefault HTTP Nodes listens at node port (7080)-->Broker wide Listener
Bydefault SOAP Nodes listens at eg port(7800) -->Embbedded Listerner


If we want our applications to listen at node port use below command
mqsichangeproperties <brokername> -b httplistener -o HTTPListener -n startListener -v true


If we want our applications to listen at eg port use below command
mqsichangeproperties <brokername> -b httplistener -o HTTPListener -n startListener -v false


How wil you troublshoot the issues?
First wil check DB logs or file logs if we still didnt understand we will check eg logs

To enable eg logs or trace
mqsichangetrace nodename -u -e egname -l debug  --> this starts writing logs
mqsireadlog Nodename -u -e egname -f -o C:/naresh/narsh.out
mqsiformatlog -i C:/naresh/narsh.out -o C:/naresh/tracelogs.out


To disable eg logs or trace(after u found issue disable logs)
mqsichangetrace nodename -u -e egname -l none  --> this stops writing logs

To search error "E:"


mqsichangetrace test1 -n -e test -l none

mqsireadlog test1 -u -e test -f -o C:\Users\haris\IBM\IIBT10\workspaceNaresh\BARfiles\naresh.out


mqsiformatlog -i C:\Users\haris\IBM\IIBT10\workspaceNaresh\BARfiles\naresh.out -o C:\Users\haris\IBM\IIBT10\workspaceNaresh\BARfiles\tracelogs.out
